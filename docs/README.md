# AI Data Science with IBM i Reference Architecture

The goal of this reference architecture is to present the teamâ€™s insights on the projects and products that IBM i customers can use to integrate state-of-the-art AI and data science technologies into their IBM i applications, operations, and more.

The projects involved in this reference architecture are RocketCE, Rocket AI Hub, Manzan, Debezium, and Tyrico, with more to be added later.

The techniques in this architecture are what we recommend to help internal and external customers get started based on our experience. Other techniques may be equally good, but these are the ones we know best and have the most experience with.
